    <h1>Dimensions Paradox: Core Draft Summary</h1>
    
    <p>Written 09/28/21</p>
    
    <p>Dimensions Paradox is a game where you play as an entity clone of your choice. You can make a clone of your own liking by editing files of the game.</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes in a dimension, it's either inhabited or uninhabited by the entities themselves. A dimension is the space where clones sometimes live, either temporarily (vacation, stationed to be there by orders etc.) or permanently (home or something). There are settlements in some of these dimensions where clones live, and sometimes nobody lives here but only settlements, meaning that the dimension is abandoned.</p>
    
    <p>Dimensions are infinite, they aren't like spheres of planets. If you go on one direction for a very long time, you feel like there are no boundaries or it won't go back to the same spot you started walking, it will continue on forever.</p>
    
    <p>All new dimensions started out as a void. Nothingness. No life whatsoever, but clones can build artificial terrain, biome, climate, daylight cycle, settlements, and even the weather using special devices to make a thriving community in the dimension.</p>
    
    <p>In a shocking revelation, dimensions are also artificial. They're manmade by the clones to build a community of their own necessities. How are dimensions created?</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>They have to use some device to teleport to a place where it doesn't exist before, thus automatically creating that location, yet no dimension.</li>
      <li>When they arrived there, they use a special device to declare that this location will be a dimension. If you don't declare a dimension, then other clones won't find you when scanning an area for dimensions.</li>
      <li>Decide what kind of transportation security they want to with their dimension. If they go with public, then clones can freely go there without restrictions. If they go with public-secure, then some restrictions must comply before going there. If protected, they should ask permission to teleport there. Like public-secure, protected-secure is the same thing as protected but with added restrictions. Finally, private is when only a certain clone(s), clone race, group, dimension, cluster, and multiverse is allowed to go in. With the same thing in previous types, private-secure adds restrictions.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>However, sometimes the device used to teleport between dimensions can be broken or run out of power so then trying to teleport to that dimension, teleportation will immediately seize as that dimension will be deemed offline to teleport until the teleportation device is online again.</p>
    
    <p>Lastly, dimensions can't be deleted once they're created, so clones can just abandon it anytime they want.</p>
    
    <p>By the way, there are many ways to teleport to the dimension, but it is up to the modding community to implement those.</p>
    
    <p>Clusters and multiverses. Clusters are a group of dimensions that might be related to each other. Think of them as star clusters. Not all dimensions belong to clusters. Multiverse is the equivalent of a galaxy. They contain both individual dimensions and clusters.</p>
    
    <p>Spacecash is the universal currency for all dimensions. Period.</p>
    
    <p>Settlements vary. They can be simple as farms, castles, huts, prisons, buildings, to complex things as villages, towns, cities and metropolis. These things are moddable too because there are many many many settlements in real life, so the modding community can get their creative juices to make the dimension more entertaining.</p>
    
    <p>Permissions of a dimension, cluster, multiverse, and paradox allow the clone to manipulate the objects. In turn, modding can implement governments, laws, policies etc.</p>
    
    <p>Events are either evoked randomly or intentionally. Like others, this really varies so modding would be very interesting in this one!</p>
    
    <p>A paradox is the universe. Everything including dimensions is inside this thing. Different things can be done by using a RNG seed.</p>
    
    <p>Lastly, things like items, weapons, vehicles, clothing, food are moddable too.</p>
    
    <p>(I know that I keep saying that most of this is moddable, but I will promise to put "c ore" mods to make it deem mandatory for the game to run. You can try to run without mods, but it will be probably boring.)</p>
